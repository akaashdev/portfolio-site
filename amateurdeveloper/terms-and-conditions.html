          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          <br>
          <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure
            therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app,
            any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code
            of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
            versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual
            property rights related to it, still belong to Amateur Developer.</p>
          <p>Amateur Developer is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
            reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
            any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
            what you're paying for.</p>
          <p>The LogoQuiz app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service.
            It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
            imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the
            LogoQuiz app won't work properly or at all.</p>
          <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
          <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">AdMob</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Amateur Developer will not take responsibility for.
            Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can
            be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Amateur Developer cannot take responsibility for
            the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your
            data allowance left.</p>
          <p>If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
            with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
            for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party
            charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be aware that we
            assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
          <p>Along the same lines, Amateur Developer cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
            You need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to
            avail the Service, Amateur Developer cannot accept responsibility.</p>
          <p>With respect to Amateur Developer's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're using the app, it's
            important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
            we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Amateur
            Developer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
            wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
          <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS - the
            requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
            app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Amateur
            Developer does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
            with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
            terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise,
            upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
            using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
          <p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on
            this page.</p>
          <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-09-10</p>
